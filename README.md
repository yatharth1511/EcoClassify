# ♻️ EcoClassify: AI‑Powered Garbage Classification System

> **An intelligent waste‑segregation system leveraging deep learning to promote sustainability and responsible recycling.**

---

## 📄 Overview

**EcoClassify** is an AI‑powered image classification system that automatically identifies different types of garbage and recommends the correct disposal bin along with recycling guidance. The system is built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and deployed through a clean, interactive **Gradio web interface**.

The goal of this project is to assist individuals and organizations in improving **waste segregation efficiency**, reducing environmental impact, and encouraging sustainable practices.

## 🛠️ System Workflow

The project follows a modular and reproducible pipeline:

1. **📂 Data Splitting**
   `split_dataset.py` divides the dataset into:

   * Training: **70%**
   * Validation: **15%**
   * Testing: **15%**

2. **🏋️ Model Training**
   `train_resnet50.py` fine‑tunes a pre‑trained **ResNet50** model on the garbage dataset.

3. **🔍 Feature Extraction (Alternative Path)**

   * `extract_features.py` extracts deep features using ResNet50
   * `train_rf_classifier.py` trains a **Random Forest** classifier on those features

4. **📊 Evaluation**
   Evaluation scripts generate:

   * Accuracy scores
   * Confusion matrices
   * Classification reports

5. **🌐 Web App Deployment**
   `gradio_resnet_app.py` deploys the best‑performing model using **Gradio**.
